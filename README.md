# GBS_24

Simulation of **Gaussian Boson Sampling (GBS)** using a **Machâ€“Zehnder interferometer (MZI)-based linear optical network**.  
The project provides Python tools to:
- Generate squeezed vacuum states
- Build an MZI optical network
- Propagate Gaussian states through the network
- Compute output photon-number statistics
